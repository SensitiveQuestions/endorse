Description: Fit the hierarchical and non-hierarchical Bayesian measurement models proposed by Bullock, Imai, and Shapiro (2011) <DOI:10.1093/pan/mpr031> to analyze endorsement experiments.  Endorsement experiments are a survey methodology for eliciting truthful responses to sensitive questions.  This methodology is helpful when measuring support for socially sensitive political actors such as militant groups.  The model is fitted with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and produces the output containing draws from the posterior distribution.
